# echo-handler
A small test task solving based on echo http server (https://github.com/labstack/echo) with SOLID showcased 🐱‍🚀

Task:
Build an API using echo framework
First of all, you should create a handler which sends how many
days left until 1 Jan 2025 and response with HTTP 200 OK status
code.
Secondly, build a middleware, which checks HTTP
header User-Role presents and contains admin and prints
"red-button user detected" to the console (using default log
package or any 3rd party) if so.
Think about coding standards and best practices.
